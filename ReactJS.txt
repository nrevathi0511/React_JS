React JS:

Functional component: is just a simple javascript function;it
accepts the data in the form of props and returns the react element.

CLass Components: It accepts props and return react element it is
same like functional components but the main difference is class
component has private internal state as additional input that
controls the returned JSX.

HOOKs: There is no breaking changes, Their is completely opt-in & 100% 
backwards-compatible,   

JSX: JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML
in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

Prop:the word “props” implies “properties”, and its working functionality
is quite similar to HTML attributes. Basically, these props components
are read-only components.

State:It is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or
information about the component.

SetState() method: It enqueues all of the updates made to the
component state and instructs React to re-render the component.

Destructuring state & props: is an ES6 feature that makes it possible to
unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
In React, destructuring props and states improve code readability.

Event Handler: action is to be taken whenever an event is fired.
This could be a button click or a change in a text input.
*event handler is a callback routine that operates asynchronously
once an event takes place.

Binding event handler: to bind with arrow functions.
If we don't bind the 'this' keyword with the event
handler then it will point to undefined in the callback.
